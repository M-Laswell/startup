Hello GITHUB
Change from my dev enviroment

lets cause an error by commiting a dev enviro change without replacing the github change muhahahhahahahahahahh
fixed it

honestly easier to fix merge errors than i thought it might be lets go 
I remember working with github before and thought it was a lot more complicated back then but its actually pretty easy and is very convenient for keeping everything in one place and easily accesible no matter where you are working from
