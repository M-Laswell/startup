  "description": "You know in college that annoying feeling of not being sure if you forgot an assignment? Or the pit of despair you felt in your stomach when you forgot to turn something in? With the assignment tracker, we are trying to turn that into a thing of the past with a nice simple spreadsheet view of which assignments you need to get done ordered by date. Between the email and text reminder options all types of users can be catered too. Anyone with deadlines can use it just as easily! it's like having your own personal assistant there to remind you of what you need to do in the day. Easy to use simple to read and set up. There to help you get done what you need.",
